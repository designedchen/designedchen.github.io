</div>
<div class="col-sm-12 text-center"><h5>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h5>
	<p>I am doing a quick design challenge on redesiging the app. When I first start using this app, the overall experience was not good because there are elements that are unexpected and unpredictable. **Side note: I do not work for Baskin Robbins, and this case study are based on my ideas and opinions. I do not have any access to Baskin Robbins' research and data.</p>

								<h5>Problems:</h5> I discover there are a lot of problems that made this product a failure. One of the possibility of this product fails is because lack of product vision and consumer's need and goals.
<br><br>
<h5>Pain point:</h5>
								After using the app, I found few problems:
								<ul>
								  <li>Home page is full of advertising feeling.</li>
								  <li>Few of the UIs are confusing.</li>
								  <li>Links did not take me to the page that I assume it should be.</li>
									<li>Easy to get lost and had to question myself how did I get to this page.</li>
								</ul><br>
								<h5>Project Goals:</h5>To redesign the overall experience of the Baskin Robbin apps to retain customers and bring a valuable experience.
								<br><br>
								<h5>Tools Used:</h5>Sketch, Invision, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator<br>
								<br>
								<h5>Roles Played:</h5>Redesign the user experience based on research to conception and visualization and testing.<br>

The rating is based on 1-10 scale for 1 being the worst and 10 being the best. The result of the test clearly shows that some competitor apps are doing better or worse than Baskin Robbins. Those that did well have similar design pattern where it consists of 4-5 icon at the bottom of the screen. Majority of the apps have its own UI elements and they all are comprehensive.</p>		</div>

color for creating high fidelity wireframe.</p>

identify and perform the set of tasks. There were
few UI problems placement position that confuses
user and I start wondering why things were place
over there at the first place. The spacing and text
was a little bit too tight and feeling like it is very
busy which can may cause confusion. After this
testing, I conduct few more testing like A-B
testing on specifics UI and UI placement to build
a high-fidelity prototype. In terms of pain point,
user was able to use it after showing the
instruction. Users did had a struggle at first
because it is a learning curve for them.</p>

            <h4>Challenge:</h4>
  <p class="lead">During the user flow and wireframing stage, we went through different concept pathway to get
to what user are looking for. There were so many steps to get user’s goal which can be
intimating and causes frustration. We had to figure out ways to get to user’s goals in 3-4 steps or
less in the wireframing.</p>
<h4>What I learned:</h4>
  <p class="lead">I have learned research can be very diversify and may become to out of scope of in a project. It
may or may not lead to the consistent information to both user and business goals. Which is
why having multiple meeting is also play an important roles to ensure and keeping on the right
track in order to meet all goals. I also learned the frequently testing will help and improve solving
problems that user encounter before passing the final prototype to engineer team.</p>
