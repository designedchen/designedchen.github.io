	<p>Inventory app is a consumer based app that helps people to search for their inventory easily without getting fustrated. This project is a 6 week project where I will be doing the full ux design process.</p>

								<!-- People have limited storage in their brain and often times they always forgot where
their items are located and spend a countless time looking for the specific item. -->

								<h5>USER NEEDS:</h5>User needs to be able to find items easily without having to spend a too much time looking for their items.<br>

                    <p class="lead">After this usability testing, we discover pain point on the
main menu page that user has a doubt about how to
search for inventory even though the button says
inventory does not automatically will make user know
that it is also function as search button. This bring up the
the decision that we will remove the main menu page
and have the dashboard as the main page. This will help
user understands better.<br>
In addition, testers also mention a doubt about the
delete pop up message that was not clear if the delete
button on photo preview page will delete the text or
the image or both. It brought to our attention that we
will need to write it clearly without any doubt.

a result, we decided to look for inspiration from minimalistic interior
design as well as Japanese interior and garden design. I discover most colors are either shades of black or white
or beige. As a project team, we came to decision to choose beige as the
color for creating high fidelity wireframe.</p>

identify and perform the set of tasks. There were
few UI problems placement position that confuses
user and I start wondering why things were place
over there at the first place. The spacing and text
was a little bit too tight and feeling like it is very
busy which can may cause confusion. After this
testing, I conduct few more testing like A-B
testing on specifics UI and UI placement to build
a high-fidelity prototype. In terms of pain point,
user was able to use it after showing the
instruction. Users did had a struggle at first
because it is a learning curve for them.</p>

            <h4>Challenge:</h4>
  <p class="lead">During the user flow and wireframing stage, we went through different concept pathway to get
to what user are looking for. There were so many steps to get user’s goal which can be
intimating and causes frustration. We had to figure out ways to get to user’s goals in 3-4 steps or
less in the wireframing.</p>
<h4>What I learned:</h4>
  <p class="lead">I have learned research can be very diversify and may become to out of scope of in a project. It
may or may not lead to the consistent information to both user and business goals. Which is
why having multiple meeting is also play an important roles to ensure and keeping on the right
track in order to meet all goals. I also learned the frequently testing will help and improve solving
problems that user encounter before passing the final prototype to engineer team.</p>
